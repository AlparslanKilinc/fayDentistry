    "welcome_message": "At Manhattan Dentistry, we want to partner with you to create a healthy, beautiful smile that will last a lifetime. Our practice is designed to provide the highest standard of patient care in a relaxing and comfortable environment. We use advanced techniques and the latest technology to ensure that our work looks great, feels great, and stands the test of time. Your first visit to our office will involve a comprehensive oral examination, including radiographs, so that I can assess your current oral health and determine if you need any treatment beyond a routine cleaning. Based on the findings of the initial exam and any other concerns you raise during the appointment, I will work with you to create a plan that preserves, restores or creates your ideal smile. If you have any questions regarding treatment, scheduling or our practice in general, please do not hesitate to call. I look forward to meeting you soon and thank you for entrusting me with your dental care."
